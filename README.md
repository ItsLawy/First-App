# First-App

Hello!, this's the very first app i make in my journey to learn react ,
and building an electron app was the best choice for me, since i have always wanted
to build an electron app.

<h2>why did i build this app ?</h2>
i made this app mainly for my dad , he have always struggled with the amount of orders he gets in his textiles company,
and he's a trader so he really wanted an app to help him out and to keep track of his orders, and he asked me if i could do an app, 
even though it was a really big challenge since im still a CS student who only still learning C in university i decided to to a step further 
and learn everything on my own , and i guess it paid off ! ,i managed to create an app the displays all the orders , customers and the companies that my dad works for , the app was built using react and electron and with the help of viete for packaging, i decided to just publish the app 
just in case if anyone has the same enviroment as my dad's work hopefully it help someone out there ! 
many thanks.
